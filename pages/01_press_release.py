    FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

    [Durham, 04/2024] â€” A team of talented students at Duke University has unveiled a cutting-edge new application that is sure to catch the eye of pop culture enthusiasts and technology aficionados alike: the "CelebParentMatch," a celebrity look-alike generator. Developed as part of a class project, this app uses advanced machine learning techniques to analyze user-submitted photos and identify which celebrities the user most resembles and therefore identifies a set of celebrity parents for the user.

    **About CelebParentMatch** 

    CelebParentMatch harnesses the power of the extensive cropped IMDB-Faces dataset, which contains about 90,000 images of various celebrities, to offer users a fun and engaging way to connect with the world of stardom. By applying facial recognition algorithms (DeepFace, specifically), CelebParentMatch compares user facial features with those of celebrities to find the parental matches. CelebParentMatch identifies both a potential father and mother, while not all families look like this it provides a fun glimpse into your best matches.

    **Features of CelebParentMatch** 

    User-Friendly Interface: Easy upload and instant results.
    Privacy-Focused: Your photos are your business. We forget them faster than a celebrity forgets an ex.

    CelebParentMatch is not just a source of entertainment. It has educational value in demonstrating the capabilities of artificial intelligence and machine learning, especially in the field of computer vision.
